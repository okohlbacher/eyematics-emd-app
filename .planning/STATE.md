# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-23)

**Core value:** Every user sees only authorized data, with tamper-proof audit trail — while maintaining the zero-friction local development experience.
**Current focus:** Phase 24 — feedback-fixes

## Current Position

Phase: 24 (feedback-fixes) — EXECUTING
Plan: 4 of 4
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-05-01

## Milestones Shipped

| Version | Name | Phases | Shipped |
|---------|------|--------|---------|

| v1.1 | Frontend ↔ Backend Wiring | — | earlier |
| v1.5 | Site Roster Correction & Cohort Analytics | 7–9 | 2026-04-15 |
| v1.6 | Outcomes Polish & Scale | 10–13 | 2026-04-17 |

| v1.8 | Session Resilience & Test/Code Polish | 18–20 | 2026-04-23 |

## v1.9 Scope

**Themes:**

- Codebase consistency audit (duplicated utilities, divergent patterns, naming)
- Documentation consistency (.planning, README, inline docs)
- Test-suite green (fix 3 pre-existing failures)
- Session UAT → automated (Phase 20's 5 human-verification items)
- Dependency + lint cleanup

**Not in scope:** KEYCLK-01 (Keycloak OIDC redirect), SESSION-10/11 (force sign-out, stateful refresh-sessions), Playwright E2E (MSEL-04 gap stays deferred), new product features.

**Starting phase number:** 21

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions (carried from v1.8, still authoritative)

- All `jwt.verify()` call sites route through `server/jwtUtil.ts` with HS256 hard pin; ESLint `no-restricted-imports` enforces.
- AuditPage uses useReducer state machine; `describeAction` lives at `src/pages/audit/auditFormatters.ts`.
- Refresh storage: httpOnly `Secure` `SameSite=Strict` cookie scoped to `/api/auth/refresh`.
- Session caps: 8h refresh TTL / 12h absolute, configurable via `settings.yaml` (`auth.refreshTokenTtlMs` / `auth.refreshAbsoluteCapMs`).
- Codebase has no jest-dom — RTL uses queryByText().not.toBeNull() / .toBeNull() (Vitest/Chai native).

### Todos

- `/gsd-plan-phase 21` — after ROADMAP.md is written

### Blockers

- None
